				<h3> Welcome to our Blog </h3>
				<p> A blog is like a book that is read aloud while it is being written, in that the result is the same. I've always wanted to start a blog, so here! Done... ... ... Oh well, I have a blog now. What should I write? Probably something, and I should get the comments going soon as soon as I install the php servers. If you could, email me.

				<h3>The Skirmish</h3>
				<p>
					<q>He who gives up a little freedom for a little security deserves neither.</q>-Benjamin Franklin 
				</p>
				<p>
					The regiments clashed together like petty schoolchildren.
					Each man armed with weapons as to kill, if they wanted to, yet collectively, they chose to simply hurl sticks, stones, and insults at each other,
					like some petty urchins common in the streets of London.
					Their Commanding Officers -leading from behind- were looking at their scruffy recruits with obvious disappointment.
					&rdquo;Use your swords you bloody fools! What's the use with throwing rocks?&rdquo;
					But to no avail, for that the men have collectively agreed upon the fact that they were to simply to torment the others, like they've done back home.
					In the field of war, the young peasants -in the absence of any training- had assumed that the battlefield was like back home; throw a bunch of rocks and try to scare them off.
				</p>
				<p>
					By now, the peasants had tried to charge each other, but while one side assumed formation, the other side would attempt to flank them and then they dissolve back into a mob.
					The not commisioned officers in charge of all of this eventually grew tired of waiting and simply engaged in melee combat. The men, now having grown bored of themselves and quite too tired for their likings,
					sat down and became spectators for the match; some even placed bets on who would win. From the outside, it would seem to be an illegal fighting club, and to be fair, it may as well be.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Colonel and his men, have spotted this mess, took a stern dislike and proceeded to intervene, giving a hard berating to both sides. 
					The officers and his men, now having assumed to be schoolchildren, promptly got marched back to camp.
